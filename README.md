# IS413_Assignment_1

DESCRIPTION:
Build first web app using ASP.NET

INSTRUCTIONS:
Build an ASP.NET Web App using the same structure as in the "Building First Web App" series of videos. (i.e. Non-MVC)

Include:

Title
Header that lists your preferred name
A picture of yourself doing something you enjoy
A paragraph on what you hope to get out of this IS 413 class
A list of the Top #3 jobs you are most interested in pursuing when you graduate
A "Grade Calculator" form that takes as input a percentage of each grade category listed in the syllabus
An icon for the website (displayed on the tab next to the title) (#notcoveredinthevideos)
Style the site using a CSS file.  Level of styling is up to you, but only CSS for now.  (No Bootstrap, Angular, etc. on this assignment. We'll get there!)

Build a JavaScript program that calculates and displays both a final percentage and a letter grade using the "Grade Calculator" form entries based on the weights listed in the syllabus.

As always, write good code (use indentation, commenting, whitespace, descriptive variable names, etc.)

Submit a link to the GitHub Repository containing your project. (NOTE:  Make sure the repository is Public so the TAs can access it.)  Alternatively, you can zip the project folder up and upload that .zip file.
